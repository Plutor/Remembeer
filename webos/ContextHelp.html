<!History Help ------------------------------------------------------------>
<body>
<p>The History card displays all of the beers consumed, the container, the date consumed, and the rating given to that beer in 0-5 stars.
<p>If you tap on "+ Add a beer", the Add a Beer card will be displayed and you will be able to enter 
information on the beer you are currently drinking. 
<p>If you tap on a beer in the history list,
the Beer Info card will be displayed, which will allow to enter more detailed information on
the beer. You may also add or modify the rating and notes on that individual beer.
<p>If you tap and hold on a beer in the list, you will be prompted to either make another entry
for another of the same beer you are consuming (drink another), or to edit the beer info
for the beer, the same action as simply taping the beer list item. 
<p>To delete a beer item from
the history list, swipe left to right on the item and select "Delete". If you decide not
to delete that beer item, you can select "Cancel" to keep it.
<p>While viewing the "History" card, you may select the command menu item "Sort..."
to resort the list of items. This opens up a submenu with two of three sorting options available;
"Sort By Date", "Sort By Rating", and "Sort By Beer Name". 
The default sorting method is by date with the most recent beer at
the top of the list. The list items will be labeled "Sort By Beer Name" and "Sort by Rating".
If the first is selected, the list will become sorted alphabetically. The latter will cause the list to
be sorted in decending order by the number of rating stars. The submenu is modified after each sort
to allow the other two sort methods to be available.
The sort method selected is persistent unless the application is reinstalled.
<p>Also available while on the "History" card is the "Import/Export" command menu
item. This will display a popup menu which allows you to choose to export the
current history and beer info via an email body (the only export method currently
supported. Export to a file may be enabled when web OS 2.0 comes available) or to 
import a beer list from a file. NOTE: Importing data will completely overwrite
your history and beer list (shown in "Add a Beer"). The format of this file 
can be determined by examining the exported data and is equivalent to the 
data exported by Remembeer for the Android OS and the file must be placed in the
root directory on the phone when it is plugged into a computer as a USB drive.
<p>This card may be chosen as the first card displayed when the program is started, or as the next
card displayed after "Add a Beer" in
"Preferences", which can be reached from most cards by accessing the command menu
(tap the extreme upper left corner of the screen). This screen may also be reached 
from this same command menu by selecting "History".
</body>
<!Add a Beer Help ----------------------------------------------------------->
<body>
<p>The Add a Beer card allows you to add a beer to the history list by specifying at least
its name. If you tap and hold on the beer name field, all of the different beer names which
were entered into Remembeer previously will be displayed in a list for you to choose from.
<p>You can also choose the container the beer is in as one of 3 choices; bottle, can,
draught, or growler (keg).
<p>You can specify the time the beer was consumed as the current time or some previous
time, such as ten minutes ago, last night, or a specific date and time. NOTE: Specific times
must be in the past. You can not specify a future drinking time.
<p>You can also make additional notes about where you are drinking it, the occasion, etc.
pertaining to this particular individual beer.
<p>When you tap "Save Beer!", this information is saved in the history list. You may 
later modify or add to the notes you enter here on the "Beer Info" card. If the "Drink When" time
is not "Now", the Beer Info card will be presented for you to provide a rating for
this beer (this assumes you have already tasted it).
<p>The next card displayed
is determined by the entry "Beer Add Next Screen" in "Preferences". Which ever entry in this
list that was selected will be displayed next.
<p>This card may be chosen as the first card displayed when the program is started, or as the
next card shown after "Add a Beer" in
"Preferences", which can be reached from most cards by accessing the command menu
(tap the extreme upper left corner of the screen). This screen may also be reached 
from this same command menu by selecting "Add a Beer". 
</body>
<!Beer Info Help ---------------------------------------------------------->
<body>
<p>On the Beer Info card, you can specify the rating you would assign to this beer on
a scale of zero to five stars, with five stars being the best beer. This is a purely subjective
scale and up to the indiviual how to make this assessment.
<p>You can also modify or add to the notes for this particular beer which were entered on the
"Add a Beer" screen.
<p>There are also additional fields for entering information pertaining to all beers
with this name. These are the brewery which makes it, the brewery location, the style of beer,
its alcohol content by volume (ABV) as a decimal percent, and additional notes
about the beer.
<p>The beer info will pertain to all beers with this name and will show for additional beers
which you may record. If modified, this information will change for all beers with this
name.
<p>When you tap on "Save Rating" or "Save Info", all of the enetered data will be
stored and you will be returned to the previous card.

<!Preferences Help ---------------------------------------------------->
<body>
<p>Basic Settings<br>On the Preferences card, you can set various ways you want Remembeer to operate.
You can set the initial card to be displayed as one of "History" (default when first using Remembeer),
"Add a Beer" or "Statistics". Also, you can set the next card shown after an Add Beer
is performed. The same three cards are also available as options here. There are two background styles which can
be selected for Remembeer. The default background is "Beers", which is very colorful and uses
pictures of various beer types or the card backgrounds. You can also select "White on Black",
which is the scheme used by the Android phone version (original) of the app, and may, in some cases,
be more readable.
<p>Reminder Settings<br>When you add a beer and specify "Drink Now" as the time you are drinking it,
a notification can be set in the phone to remind you to rate the beer. If you would
like to get this notification each time, select the check mark next to "Set Rating Reminders".
If you select a time in the past for when this beer was consumed, you will be
immediately prompted for the rating.
<p>If you select "Show Rating Reminders", you can also set the amount of delay 
before being reminded. This can be any value from 5 to 59 minutes. To set the delay,
tap on the displayed area with the number and select from the list of times.
<p>Social Settings<br>If you are a member of Twitter, you can post all of your "Drink Now" beers by
selecting the check mark beside " Post 'Drink Now' beers...". When you do, you will be 
directed to log into Twitter and then to input a displayed pin number. This is all
done on a single card which has a scrollable area at the top where the Twitter
prompts will appear and a space to input the pin and then tap a button to complete the 
authorization. If you want to stop postings, simply un-check the box. THe next time you 
check it, you will have to complete the authorization again.<br><b>NOTE:</b> Un-checking
the box does not cancel the authorization on Twitter for the Remembeer program.
This can only be done by logging onto Twitter through a web browser and visiting your
profile to remove the authorization.
</body>
<!Statistics Help ---------------------------------------------------->
<body>
<p>The Statistics card is accessed through the command menu (tap the extreme upper left corner
of the screen) and selecting "Statistics". This card displays a number of values
determined by examining the beer database kept by Remembeer.
<p>This card may be chosen as the first card displayed when the program is started, or as
the next card displayed after Add a Beer, in
"Preferences", which can be reached from most cards by accessing the command menu.
